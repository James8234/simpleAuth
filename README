## Project Overview
A secure C++ Authentication application thats design to follow the NIST 800-63B standards for secure login and account creation.
It includes file-based account storage using openSSL sha-512, passwording hashing combind with bloom filters to check prevent
common passwords, and safe file locking to ensure data integrity.

## Features
- Enforing 8 characters or longer for passwords
- Enforing strong passwords by preventing common passwords
- SHA-512 evp password hashing for storage
- Prevents users from using exist idenitys
- File locking ('flock')
- Wazuh-compatible JSON logs for account creation and login attempts
- Forarding authentication logs to wazuh
- Public IP logging with libcurl 
- textfile database
- Access controls

## Dependencies
- 'libcurl'  - curl 8.5.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/8.5.0 OpenSSL/3.0.13 zlib/1.3
    Install: 'sudo apt install libcurl14-openssl-dev'
- 'libssl'   - OpenSSL 3.0.13 30 Jan 2024 (Library: OpenSSL 3.0.13 30 Jan 2024)
	Install: 'sudo apt install libssl-dev'

## Makefile example
LIBS = -lssl -lcrypto -lcurl

## Sensitive File Handling
This project creates and uses sensitive directories such as:
- 'log/' - Runtime logs (e.g. account creation or authentication attempts)
- 'shadow/' - Hashed usernames and passwords

The reason is that real logs or credeentials should never be uploaded to a public repo.

## log file access controls
To ensure log confidentiality and proper integration with Wazuh, this project uses **group-based access control**:
drwxr-x--- 2 test wazuhAgent 4096 Jul 1 14:37 log/
-rw-r----- 1 test wazuhAgent 1769 Jul  1 12:19 auth.log
-rw-r----- 1 test wazuhAgent 2022 Jun 30 19:26 create.log

This setup:
- Allows Wazuh to forward logs securely.
- Prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive log data.
- Demonstrates the principle of least privilege in log handling.

## Wazuh Log forwarding
Note: The JSON log files shown below will be forwarded to wazuh under "ossec.conf" for anaysis.
# Custom log forwarding: ossec.conf examples:
<localfile>
	<log_format>json</log_format>
	<location>/var/log/auth.log</location>
</localfile>

# Custom Decoder: /var/ossec/etc/decoders/my_decoder.xml - Note Wazuh already has default decoderd for json standard vaild format
<decoder name="custom-json">
  <prematch type="json">event</prematch>
  <json_fields>
    <field name="event" />
    <field name="username" />
    <field name="ip" />
    <field name="timestamp" />
    <field name="status" />
    <field name="username_attempt" />
    <field name="duplicate_count" />
  </json_fields>
</decoder>

# Custom Rule: /var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml
<group name="authentication,"><group name="authentication,">
  <rule id="100001" level="7">
    <decoded_as>json</decoded_as>
    <field name="event">IP_ACCOUNT_DUPLICATION_WARNING</field>
    <description>IP reused for multiple account attempts</description>
    <group>authentication_failed</group>
  </rule>

<group name="authentication,authentication_failures,">
  <rule id="100011" level="5">

    <field name="event">login_attempt</field>
    <match key="status">failed</field>
    <description>Custom: Failed login attempt</description>

  </rule>
</group>

## JSON Log example
# Below: When an user creates an account
{"event":"account_creation","username":"joe","ip":"93.185.432.34","timestamp":"2025-06-15T13:45:20Z"}
# Below: When an user attempts to login to their account
{"event":"login_attempt","username":"joe","status":"success","ip":"93.185.432.34","timestamp":"2025-06-15T13:45:20Z"}
# Below: When user go's to create an account with a public IP address matches an existing account.
{"event":"IP_ACCOUNT_DUPLICATION_WARNING","ip":"93.185.432.34","username_attempt":"c123","timestamp":"2025-06-15T13:45:20Z","duplicate_count":3}

## Comments
"While a change password feature is often essential in production systems, this project focuses on initial account creation, secure authentication, and NIST-compliant password enforcement. Password changes require efficient updates to stored hashes and salts, which is 
better suited for a structured database. This feature may be added in a future version. While a change password feature is often essential in production systems, this project focuses on initial account creation, secure authentication, and NIST-compliant password

This project uses the RockYou password dataset due to its common usage in security education and password research.
 While it is an older dataset, it remains highly relevant in cybersecurity training environments. It is noted that
the common passwords people use have changed sense 2009, but some are still relevant.
